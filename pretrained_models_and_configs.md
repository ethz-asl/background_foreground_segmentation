## Download and set up the pretrained models and the configuration files.
- Download from [link removed for anonymity, the folder 'configs_and_models' is already part of the supplement] the folder containing the pretrained models and the configuration files.
In the following, let us denote the path where the folder is saved via the environmental variable `SAVED_FOLDER`, e.g.:
    ```bash
    export SAVED_FOLDER=/home/user/configs_and_models
    ```
- Define the environmental variable `PRETRAINED_MODELS_FOLDER` to be the path of the subfolder containing the pretrained models, e.g.:
    ```bash
    export PRETRAINED_MODELS_FOLDER=${SAVED_FOLDER}/models
    ```
- Edit the placeholder `PRETRAINED_MODELS_FOLDER` in the `config.yml` files to be the above path:
    ```bash
    cd ${SAVED_FOLDER}
    find . -type f -name '*.yml' -exec sed -i "s@PRETRAINED_MODELS_FOLDER@${PRETRAINED_MODELS_FOLDER}@g" {} +
    ```

## Re-run the training
To re-run a training job, use the `config.yml` from the experiment folder downloaded as detailed above, and run the corresponding training script shown in the tabel below. For instance, for experiment ID 1059, from the root folder run:
```bash
python train_binary_segmodel_base.py with ${SAVED_FOLDER}/configs/1059/config.yml
```
